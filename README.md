# P5.JS Experiments

Created this repo to save some P5.JS experiments.

I have similar repo for processing, but since now I've started studying p5, this is the one.

Just playing around with the language.

As of now they are basically Hello Worlds.

**Note:** The "output.mp4" v√≠deos were made with some screen capturing + some ffmpeg magic.

I'll try to to create a bash script to make these "boomerang like videos" using ffmpeg.

We'll see.
